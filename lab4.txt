COMP484, Summer 2016 - Lab #4
Danielle Yamane (worked alone)

Files included in Lab4.zip:

The project is 100% complete; a basic/functional registration and login.
The extra credit is completed; an additional column, salt, was added to the table (user). The password stored uses SHA-512, to hash the password+salt. No plaintext passwords are kept in the database.

No known bugs... at least to my knowledge.
